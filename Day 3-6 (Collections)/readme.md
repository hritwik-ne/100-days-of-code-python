# Collections module

## Day 1: Your new data structure friends

Welcome to this lesson. Today you will learn about some powerful new data structures: `namedtuple`, `defaultdict`, `Counter` and `deque`.

Today you watch the videos. I also prepared a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/04-06-collections/collections.ipynb) so you can follow along with this lesson.

## Day 2: Practice using movie data

You get to use these new data structures I encourage you to code an exercise: [PyBites Code Challenge 13 - Highest Rated Movie Director](https://pybit.es/codechallenge13.html). 

See the [notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/04-06-collections/collections.ipynb) for more info how to complete this exercise.

You can also take a slimmed down version of this exercise [on our platform](https://codechalleng.es/bites/30/).

## Day 3: More practice on your own data

We challenge you to find your own data set and try to use the new collections data structures yourself.
